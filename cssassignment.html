            <p>
                Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair,
                In seventy-seven and sixty-nine, revolution was in the air,
                I was born too late to a world that doesn't care,
                Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stuck in the wrong time capsule, it's a Dinosaur disaster,
                I should have been born in a Woodstock pastor,
                But like, too late, no, no, no, it's too late,
                And I don't remember a thing in '69.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born too late
                And I'll never be as cool as the punk rockers.
                I was born too soon
                And I'll never be as cool as the punk rockers.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I started up a band, but we all played in different tunes,
                And I got taken by a guy who took me for a fool,
                And I ended up in Denmark and wrote my first song,
                There's a lot more to life than being right or wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born too late
                And I'll never be as cool as the punk rockers.
                I was born too soon
                And I'll never be as cool as the punk rockers.
